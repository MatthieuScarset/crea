# CREA

A community-driven marketplace for creators.

## Goals

**Create a _shared media bank_**

Allow creators to publish their work while keeping control of the ownership and 
authorship with NFTs. 

Enable the other creators to reuse the media in this bank by paying royalties to
authors.

**Create an easy-to-use _marketplace_**

Allow customers to quickly create tailor-made request for proposals, thanks to a
flexible _contract_ form.

Enable creators to answer projects and to submit their work privately.

Guarantee payment of work at all time in the project, thanks to deposits on-chain.

**Create a _Universal pricing_**

Allow creators to fix rates for all kinds of creative works through a governance system.

# CREA

A community-driven marketplace for creators.


## Goals

**Create a _shared media bank_**

Allow creators to publish their work while keeping control of the ownership and 
authorship with NFTs. 

Enable the other creators to reuse the media in this bank by paying royalties to
authors.

**Create an easy-to-use _marketplace_**

Allow clients to quickly create tailor-made request for work.

Requests and specifications will be immutable, hosted on IPFS network.

Creators can answer projects and submit their work privately.

Payment guarantee is total at all times of the project, thanks to the smart 
contract's term - especially with on-chain deposits from both parties.

**Create a _Universal pricing_**

Allow creators to fix rates for all kinds of creative works through a governance system.

The provider knows how much its work is worth, not the client.

It will fix the current situation where creators are competing against their peers
in a worldwide and unfair market - where prices are lowered continuously.
